## matplotlib

Custom license

matplotlib uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to matplotlib. But, it is important to note that these
contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the
matplotlib source code, in its entirety, is not the copyright of any single
person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire
matplotlib Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a
record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they
should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they
commit the change to one of the matplotlib repositories.
